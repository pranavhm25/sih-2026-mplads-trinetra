"""SIH demo scenario: a completed human investigation of an AI risk flag.

Creates one InvestigationCase on the flagship duplicate pair (MPL-10281 ↔
MPL-10412) and walks it through the full lifecycle:

    OPEN → UNDER_REVIEW → FIELD_VERIFICATION → CLOSED (NOT_SUBSTANTIATED)

The investigator verifies the two works with the district office and finds
they are separate sanctioned projects — the duplicate concern is not
substantiated. Every step is recorded in the case audit trail; the original
AI-generated signals remain untouched as historical detection evidence.

Demo story this implements (PRD R12 / SIH prompt): "TRINETRA identifies a
risk. A case enters investigation. The investigator reviews the evidence,
finds a legitimate explanation, and records the outcome 'Not substantiated'.
The audit trail preserves the decision, and the dashboard counts the case as
concluded — not as unresolved."

AI FLAG ≠ FRAUD: the scenario ends in a human outcome, never a verdict.
