"""CAG pattern catalog — data, not code (single source of truth).

The catalog records irregularity PATTERNS documented in real CAG audits of
MPLADS, together with the TRINETRA detector that could identify each pattern
and the validation method used to demonstrate the capability.

Layer discipline (mirrors docs/CAG_VALIDATION.md §1):

  1. SOURCE       — verified CAG finding (report number, paragraph, quote)
  2. MAPPING      — TRINETRA's interpretation: which detector targets the pattern
  3. VALIDATION   — controlled synthetic reproduction of the pattern's
                    structural characteristics

Nothing in this file is a real MPLADS work record. Fixture data lives in
app/data/fixtures/cag_patterns.csv and is always ingested with
is_synthetic=True (AGENTS_RULES.md Rule 6).
