### P1
- [ ] Risk Replay.
- [x] CAG-informed rule references.
- [x] CAG-grounded pattern validation layer (docs/CAG_VALIDATION.md):
      verified CAG findings → pattern catalog → synthetic reproduction →
      unmodified detector run → honest per-pattern results; 25 automated
      tests; Evidence & Validation screen.
- [x] Synthetic model validation framework (docs/SYNTHETIC_VALIDATION.md):
      deterministic injection engine with ground truth, scenario matrix,
      precision/recall/F1/FPR/confusion metrics, machine-readable artifact,
      CLI runner + API + Synthetic Model Validation panel; 19 automated tests.
- [x] Contextual duplicate-candidate validation ("similarity ≠ duplication"):
      TF-IDF kept as candidate generator; geospatial + vendor-overlap gates,
      contextual confidence bands, evidence rows, confidence-gated severity
      and fusion weight; migration d8e9f0a1b2c3; 22 automated tests
      (tests/test_duplicate_context.py) incl. boilerplate-FP matrix and
      MPL-10281 flagship verification.
- [x] Demo resilience layer (docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md): /api/v1/health/ready
      readiness probe (DB + demo data, 200/503), bounded GET retry layer in
      api.ts, waking-backend UI states (BackendGate), scripts/prewarm-demo.py
      (pre-warm + read-only demo check), runbook with measured timings;
      8 backend tests + 6 frontend tests. Dashboard signal queries chunked
      under SQLite's bind-variable limit (500 on >999-project datasets).
- [x] Not-substantiated case outcome (PRD R12 extension, "AI FLAG ≠ FRAUD"):
      CLOSED status with enforced state machine (OPEN → UNDER_REVIEW →
      FIELD_VERIFICATION → RESOLVED | ESCALATED | CLOSED), mandatory
      NOT_SUBSTANTIATED outcome + structured reason category + free-text
      explanation, STATUS_CHANGED audit events, immutable AI signals,
      dashboard/stakeholder counts exclude concluded cases, cleared-case PDF
      outcome section, investigator outcome form (neutral wording) + AI
      disclaimer banner, seeded demo scenario on MPL-10281 (bootstrap,
      DEMO_AUTOSEED); migration e1a2b3c4d5e6 (resolution_reason); 20 backend
      + 3 frontend tests (tests/test_case_outcomes.py, Cases.test.tsx).
- [ ] Officer feedback analytics.
- [ ] Compliance dashboard.

## Testing Checklist

### Backend
- [ ] Unit tests for every detection rule.
- [x] CAG validation tests (fixture provenance, detector execution, honest
      result generation, language discipline, API surface).
- [x] Synthetic validation tests (determinism, injection correctness,
      ground truth, metric math incl. toy dataset, zero-division, JSON
      serialization, end-to-end scenario, DB cleanup).
- [ ] Unit tests for fusion.
- [ ] API integration tests.
- [ ] Dataset fixture tests.
- [ ] Case state transition tests.
- [ ] Report generation test.

### Frontend
- [ ] Dashboard loads.
- [ ] Filters work.
- [ ] Queue opens project.
- [ ] Project evidence expands.
- [ ] Case creation works.
- [ ] Report generation works.
- [ ] Mobile/tablet degradation is acceptable.

## Definition of Done

A task is done only when:
1. It works with the canonical demo dataset.
2. Its output is explainable.
3. Errors have a visible state.
4. It does not silently fabricate missing data.
5. It is connected to the main user flow.
6. It has at least a basic test or reproducible manual test.
