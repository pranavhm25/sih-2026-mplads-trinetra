# TRINETRA — Technical Requirements Document

## 1. Technical Objective

Build a modular web application that transforms MPLADS/e-SAKSHI-style data into explainable investigation intelligence.

Recommended stack from the solution brief:
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Maps:** Leaflet
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Python
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Validation:** Pydantic
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ML:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **NLP:** TF-IDF + cosine similarity; Sentence Transformers optional
- **Reports:** ReportLab

SQLite may be used temporarily if deployment speed becomes a constraint.

## 2. Functional Technical Requirements

### TR-01 Data ingestion
The API shall accept a normalized CSV/dataset and map source columns into a canonical project schema.

### TR-02 Provenance
Every imported dataset shall have:
- source label
- ingestion timestamp
- dataset version
- synthetic/official/demo classification
- row count
- validation summary

### TR-03 Validation
Validation shall run before anomaly detection.

Minimum rules:
- required identifiers present
- dates logically ordered
- expenditure <= sanctioned amount unless explicitly marked as an exception
- progress values within expected bounds
- numeric fields parseable
- duplicate work IDs detected

### TR-04 Derived metrics
The backend shall calculate:
- cost deviation
- expenditure ratio
- financial/physical gap
- elapsed days
- expected duration
- delay days
- peer percentile
- peer median
- duplicate candidate score
- ML anomaly score
- agency concentration where data exists

### TR-05 Rule engine
Rules must be independently executable and return structured evidence.

Example:
```json
{
  "rule_code": "FIN_PHYS_GAP",
  "triggered": true,
  "severity": "high",
  "evidence": {
    "financial_progress": 84,
    "physical_progress": 32,
    "gap": 52
  }
}
```

### TR-06 ML engine
Isolation Forest must run against a stable feature set. The ML result is one evidence signal and must not directly become a fraud verdict.

### TR-07 NLP duplicate detection
Normalize descriptions before comparison. Use TF-IDF/cosine similarity for the MVP. Optionally add sentence embeddings later.

**Contextual validation ("similarity ≠ duplication").** TF-IDF is a
*candidate generator*: it measures linguistic similarity, which government
boilerplate produces constantly. A pair only becomes a STRONG duplicate
candidate when independent contextual evidence agrees:

| Stage | Signal | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Generate | TF-IDF cosine + weighted component score | linguistic similarity only; never duplication proof |
| Validate | geospatial proximity (haversine) | `DUPLICATE_GEO_STRONG_M = 50 m` strong band; `> DUPLICATE_GEO_MAX_M = 2000 m` contradicts the text match; missing coordinates make the signal UNAVAILABLE, never zero-distance |
| Validate | vendor overlap | normalized token-set overlap of implementing agencies (`DUPLICATE_VENDOR_MIN_TOKEN_OVERLAP = 0.5`); missing agency data → UNAVAILABLE |
| Decide | contextual confidence | high = geo-close + same agency · medium = exactly one independent signal agrees · low = a signal contradicts the text match (boilerplate similarity) · unavailable = no contextual data |
| Score | fusion gating | low/unavailable-confidence DUPLICATE signals contribute `DUPLICATE_WEAK_CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT = 0.6×` of the standard weight, so text similarity alone cannot drive an unjustified priority |

Every candidate persists five evidence rows (text generator, geospatial
proximity, vendor overlap, cost similarity, contextual confidence) and the
link records `vendor_match` + `contextual_confidence` for the API/UI.

### TR-08 Peer benchmarking
Peer groups should be configurable using combinations of:
- district
- category
- sector
- financial year
- approximate project size

### TR-09 Evidence fusion
The fusion layer shall preserve individual signals and calculate a transparent priority using configured weights/logic.

### TR-10 API
All frontend functionality shall use typed REST APIs rather than direct database access.

### TR-11 Auditability
Important state transitions and officer actions shall be recorded.

### TR-12 Reporting
Reports must be generated from persisted case/project evidence and include a generation timestamp and report identifier.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Dashboard API should return common aggregate views quickly on demo-sized data.
- Filtering should be server-side for large datasets.
- ML/NLP processing should run asynchronously for large imports.

### Reliability
- Failed ingestion should not partially corrupt the dataset.
- Detection jobs should have explicit status: queued, running, completed, failed.
- Errors must be visible to administrators without exposing stack traces to normal users.

### Security
- Authentication should be required for non-demo deployments.
- Role-based authorization should separate administrator, investigator and supervisor capabilities.
- Sensitive data should not appear in application logs.
- Database credentials must be environment variables/secrets.

### Explainability
Every investigation priority must be decomposable into signals and evidence.

### Reproducibility
A detection run should be tied to:
- dataset version
- rule version
- model version
- execution timestamp

```

## 7. Testing Requirements

### Unit tests
- validation rules
- derived metric calculations
- peer calculations
- duplicate scoring
- evidence fusion
- case state transitions

### Case outcome lifecycle tests (PRD R12 — AI FLAG ≠ FRAUD)
- valid transitions: OPEN → UNDER_REVIEW → FIELD_VERIFICATION →
  RESOLVED | ESCALATED | CLOSED (not substantiated)
- invalid transitions rejected (e.g. OPEN → CLOSED, RESOLVED → CLOSED)
- closing requires NOT_SUBSTANTIATED type + structured reason category
  + free-text explanation (validated centrally, useful 400 errors)
- every transition recorded in the case audit trail (from → to, actor,
  outcome, reason)
- original detection signals unchanged after closure (immutable evidence)
- NOT_SUBSTANTIATED cases excluded from dashboard open-case counts
- cleared-case PDF preserves detected signals + outcome + reason category
- reopening a closed case clears closed_at but keeps resolution history

### Integration tests
- dataset import
- detection run
- project details
- case creation
- report generation

### UI tests
- dashboard filtering
- queue filtering
- project investigation
- case creation
- report download

### Data tests
Maintain fixed synthetic fixtures for known anomaly scenarios.

### CAG-grounded validation tests (docs/CAG_VALIDATION.md)
- fixture provenance: every fixture work `CAGV-`-prefixed, dataset always
  `is_synthetic=True` with `synthetic_cag_pattern` source-label marker
- expected pattern characteristics survive ingestion
- detector execution against the unmodified pipeline (deterministic
  reference date; thresholds never modified)
- honest result generation: FLAGGED / PARTIAL / MISSED reported as
  measured; data-unavailable patterns reported NOT_VALIDATABLE, never faked
- language discipline: no claim of detecting real CAG cases, no accuracy
  metrics against unavailable real data
- API surface: `/api/v1/validation/cag` and `…/summary`### Synthetic model validation tests (docs/SYNTHETIC_VALIDATION.md)
- deterministic generation: same seed → byte-identical dataset + ground
  truth; different seed → different dataset
- injection correctness: counts, unique namespaced IDs, ground
  truth (record_id, is_injected_anomaly, anomaly_type, injection_id,
  original_record_id, expected_detector)
- metric math verified against a hand-computed toy dataset
  (TP/FP/TN/FN → precision/recall/F1/FPR/detection rate)
- zero-division handling: undefined metrics are `null`, never fabricated
- result serialization: JSON round-trip, no NaN/Infinity; totals add up
- end-to-end scenario through the unmodified pipeline + DB cleanup
- benchmark CLI: `py scripts/run_synthetic_validation.py` (deterministic)

### Demo resilience tests (docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md)
- readiness probe: 200 with demo data, 503 with checks (never a stack
  trace) when the DB is unreachable or the demo dataset is missing;
  never runs detection; session always closed
- retry layer: GET-only, bounded exponential backoff, no retry on 4xx,
  never retries mutations
- waking UX: bounded readiness polling recovers to a full render when
  the backend answers; exhausted window shows operator guidance

## 8. Deployment

Preferred architecture:
- React static frontend
- FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL database
- object/file storage for generated reports if required

For a hackathon demo, the architecture may be simplified, but service boundaries should remain clear so deployment can be expanded later.
